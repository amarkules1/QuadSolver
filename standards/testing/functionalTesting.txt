Functional testing can be performed by running the command "make functionalTest" from the main directory. 

The last line run by this command outputs any unexpected differences to the command line. 

If the last line starts with "diff", the functional tests all passed. 

When adding a new functional test, add the input line to the file tests/functionalTestIn.txt and the expected output lines (including prompts) to tests/functionalTestExpected.txt. Functional tests should cover valid input, boundary cases, and invalid input.
